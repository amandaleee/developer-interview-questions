# Developer Interview Questions

This is a list of questions to help developers get a sense of the the places they're interviewing. Because no one deserves a bad fit.

## Scheduling and general office stuff

* What is your dress code?
* What time do people generally arrive and leave?
* What is the lunch break situation? Do people eat together? Do they tend to work through lunch?
* Do developers work from home or on a non-synchronized schedule?
* If so, what tools do you use to make sure everyone communicates effectively? Do they work?
* Are there weekly or monthly staff meetings?
* On average, how much time would a developer spend per week in meetings?
* How much paid time off is given? What's the process for getting that approved?

## Permissions/do you trust me with equipment and stuff

* Will I get SSH access to your servers?
* Will I get root access to my machine?

## General stack questions

* What front-end and back-end stacks do you run? How do you choose these?
* What percent of work per week that happens within a content management system? Who has access to this CMS aside from developers?
* What percentage of your developers’ time is used to build html emails?
* Can I look at your code stack?

## Product management/process related stuff

* Is your process client-driven, or user-driven?
* How do you do user research?
* How do you determine what features get pulled into the product?
* How do you approach technical debt?
* What's the relationship between development and UX, or between development and product?
* How often am I coding from comps? Where do these come from?
* What's your company's approach to time tracking?
* What's your company's approach to estimation?
* How does the team’s leadership [or the product’s leadership] deal with unreasonable feature requests?
* How much time do you expect I'll be working on legacy products/projects, versus shipping new ones? 
* Let's say I'm in this position for a year. What would it look like for me to be a total success?
* Followup to previous question: What will our development/engineering team/product look like then, given that success? 
* Do your engineers/developers get to choose their own toolsets? [For instance, if I want to work in a Docker container rather than running MAMP locally, is that cool?]
* Followup to previous question: Do your developers get to choose their own stacks? If I want to write a thing in React, am I allowed, or do I have to stick to what you're already using?  

## Growth

* Do developers have a conference/book/research budget?
* Are there weekly or monthly one-on-ones with technical mentors?
* How do you ensure that people on your tech team continue learning?
* Do you have a 20% time policy?

## Team dynamics

* Can I meet the developers I’m working with?
* Am I taking a person’s place on the team? Why are they leaving? Where do they fall on the org chart?
* Who do I answer to?
* Do I manage/mentor anyone? 
* How does your technical/product/customer/executive leadership work on the product on a regular basis?
* How does your technical/product/customer/executive leadership use the product on a regular basis?
* Is the team growing? What are your needs right now?
* How do you avoid team-wide burnout?
* What’s the churn like? How many people have left in the last year, and why did they leave?
* How diverse are the developers here? How do you address the issue of diversity in the field?
* How important is your technology to the core of your company's mission?  

## Company dynamics

* What's the ratio of developers to non-developers company-wide?
* How do you make sure the separate teams in the office respect one another’s work?

## General operations

* Tell me about your deploy schedule. Do you use continous integration?
* Do you practice TDD?
* Pair programming? Code review? Code standards? What do I have to do to get work merged?
* If an aspect of your site/app goes down, like if a mail form stops sending mail, whose job is it to fix that?
* Who hosts your work? Rackspace, aws, heroku, managed something or other?
