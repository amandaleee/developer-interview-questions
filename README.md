# Developer Interview Questions

This is a list of questions to help developers get a sense of the the places they're interviewing. Because no one deserves a bad fit.

## Scheduling and general office stuff

* What is your dress code?
* What time do people generally arrive and leave?
* What is the lunch break situation, or what do people tend to do for lunch? Do people eat together? Do they tend to work through lunch?

* If so, what tools do you use to make sure everyone communicates effectively? Do they work?
* Are there weekly or monthly staff meetings?
* On average, how much time would a developer spend per week in meetings?

## Permissions/do you trust me with equipment and stuff

## General stack questions

* What front-end and back-end stacks do you run? How do you choose these?

* What percentage of your developers’ time is used to build html emails?
* Can I look at your code stack?
* How long does it take for a dev working in my general skill area to set up a local environment? What is involved with that? Docker, Vagrant, none of the above? 
* How often do your developers lose time to maintaining, patching, or updating their local environment? 
* What are the three biggest pain points in your stack? How is the team addressing them? 
* What have you tried to improve in the past relating to your stack, but failed at? 

## Product management/process related stuff

* Is your process client-driven, or user-driven?
* How do you do user research?
* How do you determine what features get pulled into the product?

* How does the team’s leadership [or the product’s leadership] deal with unreasonable feature requests?
* How much time do you expect I'll be working on legacy products/projects, versus shipping new ones?
* Let's say I'm in this position for a year. What would it look like for me to be a total success?
* Followup to previous question: What will our development/engineering team/product look like then, given that success?
* Do your engineers/developers get to choose their own toolsets? [For instance, if I want to work in a Docker container rather than running MAMP locally, is that cool?]
* Followup to previous question: Do your developers get to choose their own stacks? If I want to write a thing in React, am I allowed, or do I have to stick to what you're already using?
* Do you care about pixel perfection? How many UI reviews does the code undergo?
* Do you have a code standard? If so, how do you balance adherence to a standard with knowing when to revise it, or ignore it altogether?

* What in my background (or on my resume) do you see as the most beneficial for the team?
* Which departments do you interface with the most?
* Are projects usually by team, or solo? How is team assignment determined?
* What percentage of the time will I be working in/on a CMS? Which one is it?

* Does/how does your technical/product/customer/executive leadership use the product on a regular basis?
* Is the team growing? What are your needs right now?
* How do you avoid team-wide burnout?

* How important is your technology to the core of your company's mission?
